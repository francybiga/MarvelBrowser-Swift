# MarvelBrowser
My own attempt to build a TDD Sample App following Jon Reid's Marvel Browser (see <https://github.com/jonreid/MarvelBrowser>).

API Keys
-------
Create a new plist file called "configuration.plist" with your Marvel API Keys and add it to your app bundle (follow the template "configuration.plist.example").
